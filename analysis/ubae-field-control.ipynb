Note that all 22 players on the field are not shown, only the players that are relevant to the pass play. **o** stands for the orientation of the player (i.e. which way their trunk is facing) and **dir** is the movement direction of the player. These two values will rarely be the same, so it is important to keep track of both of them during our model. Also note that these angles are in degrees, calculated from due north, clockwise.

Without accounting for other variables that may influence this like individual player acceleration, ball speed, etc., we can say maybe 2 yards on either side, and maybe 1 yard forward and backward. This will give us a 'region of influence' for the receiving player. In a very simple case, we can model a region like this as a gaussian distribution, with the mean centered at the player, and a covariance describing this region. This will be highly subjective based on modelling assumptions, but we can model something as follows. Note that when we create the covariance matrix, I am assuming no covariance.

The further away you are from the ball, the wider your region of influence will be, but it will also be weaker.

Influence is a very abstract concept, so feel free to model with any assumptions you like, but we will model this model using this assumption. The further you are from the ball, the more influence you will have, up to a certain distance.

This means we need to create a region of influence that is elongated in the region that the player is running, as a function of speed.
