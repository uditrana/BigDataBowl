If we imagine two players standing still and facing each other, 5 yards apart, and one throws the football, how much can the other possible move and still catch the football? Without accounting for other variables that may influence this like individual player acceleration, ball speed, etc., we can say maybe 2 yards on either side, and maybe 1 yard forward and backward. This will give us a 'region of influence' for the receiving player. In a very simple case, we can model a region like this as a gaussian distribution, with the mean centered at the player, and a covariance describing this region. This will be highly subjective based on modelling assumptions, but we can model something as follows. Note that when we create the covariance matrix, I am assuming no covariance. The variance occurs only on the individual axes, meaning the covariance matrix is diagonal.\n\nRed refers to the receiver, and black refers to the thrower.

Note that we are not looking at the influence gained from throwing the ball, but rather at the physical influence of any player as a function of distance from the ball.

The further away you are from the ball, the wider your region of influence will be, but it will also be weaker. This is because if you are far away from the ball, it will take time for the ball to reach you. In this time, you can move further. Influence is a very abstract concept, so feel free to model with any assumptions you like, but we will model this model using this assumption. The further you are from the ball, the more influence you will have, up to a certain distance. For soccer this makes a lot of sense as the game is continuous, however for American football, we may have to change this. Once a receiver catches the ball, another receiver on the other end of the field will have no influence on the play. We have not done this yet, but this is a weakness of the current model.\n\n### Distance from the ball influence function\nThe function for distance from the ball vs influence is set relatively arbitrarily for now.

However they can also influence a much larger region in the direction that they are running because they are already running at a high velocity. This means we need to create a region of influence that is elongated in the region that the player is running, as a function of speed. When they are stationary, the variances in either direction should be the same, but as they start running, the difference between the variances should increase. For now, we will just focus on what occurs when the player runs on the basis axes. We will worry about direction later in this notebook.\n\nApart from just the covariance, the speed should also affect the mean of our region of influence. Someone who is running full speed should have less influence on the ground behind them, and more on the ground in front of them. We can model this by shifting the mu in the movement direction as a function of velocity.\n\nLet's plot this out, first by taking the low hanging fruit and plot out the mean shift. I will draw an arrow to signify the velocity of the player. We will shift the mean according to the following function\n\n$\\mathbf{\\mu^*} = \\mathbf{\\mu} + 0.5\\mathbf{v}$\n\nFor a player at the position $(0, 0)$ with a velocity vector $(6, 0)$ and no changes to the covariance matrix yet will have a covariance matrix as follows"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Player positions\nplayer_throw = np.array([0, 0])\n\nsigma_throw = np.array([[1**2, 0], [0, 1**2]])\nmu_throw = player_throw\nvel_throw = np.array([6, 0])\n\nmu_throw = mu_throw + 0.5*vel_throw\n\nrv_throw = stats.multivariate_normal(mu_throw, sigma_throw)\n\n# Create grid of points to pass into multivariate normal\nx, y = np.mgrid[-10:10:.01, -10:10:.01]\npos = np.dstack((x, y))\n\n# Plot players and \nfig = plt.figure(figsize = (10, 10))\nax = plt.gca()\nax_influence = ax.twinx()\n\n# Plot the figure\nax_influence.contourf(x, y, rv_throw.pdf(pos), alpha = 0.3, cmap = 'Greys')\n\nax.scatter(player_throw[0], player_throw[1], s = 300, color = 'k', label = 'thrower')\nax.arrow(0, 0, 6, 0, head_width = 0.2, color = 'k')\n\nax.set_xlim([-10, 10])\nax.set_ylim([-10, 10])\n\nax.xaxis.set_visible(False)\nax.yaxis.set_visible(False)\nax_influence.yaxis.set_visible(False)\n\nax.set\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now for the covariance, we need to stretch the covariance matrix along the axis that we are moving, and shrink it in the orthogonal direction as a function of velocity and distance from the ball.

The bigger the distance, the wider the covariance should be in either direction. \n\nThe initial covariance matrix we will use will be created from our distance-from-ball function $f_d(\\cdot)$.\n\n$\n\\Sigma=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    f_d(t) & 0 \\\\\n    0 & f_d(t)\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n$\n\nWe will increase this in the direction of movement (in this case in the $x$ direction). To incorporate a weighting with speed, we will take the maximum possible speed and create a weighting function. The maximum possible recorded speed as of the time of writing this notebook is 23.1 mph set by Raheem Mostert of the 49ers. This corresponds to approximately 11.3 yards per second. We don't want this to be a linear weighting either. At lower speeds, it is still easier to change direction than at higher speeds so we want the weighting to be exponential. If a player reaches a maximum speed, we want the variance to be $f_d(t)$. If the player is at 0 speed, we want the variance to be $\\frac{f_d(t)}{2}$. This seems to have been set relatively arbitrarily by the authors, but if anyone has a reason as to why they did it this way, please let me know.

This is exactly the behaviour we wanted.\n\n## Modelling how direction affects region of influence\nWhile this works if the player is moving in the x or y direction, we need to reassess how we create the covariance matrix to work for a player travelling in any direction. To do this, we can use the spectral theorem knowing that our covariance matrix is symmetric and real.\n\n>**Spectral Theorem**:\nGiven $A \\in n\\times n$ is real, symmetric matrix, it can be factorized into $A=V S V^\\top$ where the columns of $V$ contain orthonormal eigenvectors, and the diagonal of $\\Sigma$ contains the corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nThe spectral theorem is used as a basies for PCA, and the eigenvectors will encode the orthogonal directions of highest variance. I will not go into the proof here, but for a very good tutorial on PCA, please see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf) by Jonathan Shlens. Now, knowing what we know, we can work on backwards engineering a valid covariance matrix. \n\nFirst let's assume that we are taking our orientation from the x axis moving counter clockwise. By this I mean we would start at vector $(1, 0)$, and then rotate counter clockwise. Be aware that the data given by NFL starts at vector $(0, 1)$ and rotates clockwise. We will attempt to recreate $V$ first. As the columns of V will correspond to the two largest orthogonal degrees of variance, we can just think of V as a an orthonormal rotation matrix.\n\nTo better illustrate this, let us do an example. Assume that the direction is $\\pi/4$ radians, or 45 degrees. We want to move our vector $(1, 0)$ to the corresponding point at 45 degrees on the unit circle. Using basic trigonometry, this is $(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta))$. Similarly, we want to move the vector $(0, 1)$ to the corresponding point at 135 degrees. Again using basic trigonometry, this corresponds to $(-\\sin(\\theta), \\cos(\\theta))$. Both of these directions are unit normal (they are on the unit circle) and orthogonal (they are perpendicular). As such they are valid for use as orthonormal eigenvectors. As such, we can create our matrix as\n\n$\nV=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\\n    \\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta)\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n$\n\nWe will use the same eigenvalues for our matrix that we did last time. This will stretch the rotate the principle components in the corresponding direction. As a reminder, this matrix is\n\n$\nS=\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\frac{f_d(t) + f_d(t) \\cdot f_s(s)}{2} & 0 \\\\\n    0 & \\frac{f_d(t) - f_d(t) \\cdot f_s(s)}{2}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n$\n\nUsing the spectral theorem, we can now write out our new covariance matrix as\n\n$\\Sigma = VSV^\\top$\n\nTo show this in an example, I will first plot the rotation of the bases, and then the rotated multivariate gaussian."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize = (10, 10))\nax = plt.gca()\n\ntheta = np.pi/4\n\nax.arrow(0,0,1,0, color = 'k', head_width = 0.05)\nax.arrow(0,0,0,1, color = 'k', head_width = 0.05)\nax.arrow(0,0,np.cos(theta),np.sin(theta), color = 'r', head_width = 0.05)\nax.arrow(0,0,-np.sin(theta),np.cos(theta), color = 'r', head_width = 0.05)\n\nax.set_xlim([-1.5, 1.5])\nax.set_ylim([-1.5, 1.5])\n\nax.xaxis.set_visible(False)\nax.yaxis.set_visible(False)\n\nfig.show()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def speed_weighting(s):\n    return (s**2)/(11.3**2)\n\nplayer_speed = 6\ninfluence_rad = np.pi/4\n\n# Player positions\nplayer_throw = np.array([0, 0])\n\nsigma_throw = np.array([[(radius_influence(0) + radius_influence(0)*speed_weighting(player_speed))/2, 0], [0, (radius_influence(0) - radius_influence(0)*speed_weighting(player_speed))/2]])\nmu_throw = player_throw\nvel_throw = np.array([np.sqrt(18), np.sqrt(18)])\n\nR = np.array([[np.cos(influence_rad), -np.sin(influence_rad)],[np.sin(influence_rad), np.cos(influence_rad)]])\n\nsigma_rotated = R@sigma_throw@R.T\n\nmu_throw = mu_throw + 0.5*vel_throw\n\n# rv_throw = stats.multivariate_normal(mu_throw, sigma_throw)\nrv_throw = stats.multivariate_normal(mu_throw, sigma_rotated)\n\n# Create grid of points to pass into multivariate normal\nx, y = np.mgrid[-10:10:.01, -10:10:.01]\npos = np.dstack((x, y))\n\n# Plot players and \nfig = plt.figure(figsize = (10, 10))\nax = plt.gca()\nax_influence = ax.twinx()\n\n# Plot the figure\nax_influence.contourf(x, y, rv_throw.pdf(pos), alpha = 0.3, cmap = 'Reds')\n\nax.scatter(player_throw[0], player_throw[1], s = 300, color = 'r', label = 'thrower')\nax.arrow(0, 0, vel_throw[0], vel_throw[1], head_width = 0.2, color = 'r')\n\nax.set_xlim([-10, 10])\nax.set_ylim([-10, 10])\n\nax.xaxis.set_visible(False)\nax.yaxis.set_visible(False)\nax_influence.yaxis.set_visible(False)\n\nax.set\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note how using the above formulation, we can now easily rotate the regions of influence as we like!\n\nThat is it!
